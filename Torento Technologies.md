## FIRST TECHNICAL ROUND - QUESTIONS (30)

1. Can you walk me through your current role and explain what exactly you are responsible for on a day-to-day basis?

2. Tell me about a production-grade AWS or Azure architecture you have worked on. How does the traffic flow from the user to the application?

3. In your experience, where do you usually place application workloads in AWS — public or private subnets — and why?

4. Suppose your application is deployed in a private subnet and suddenly it is not able to reach the internet. How would you start troubleshooting this?

5. Can you explain how Security Groups and NACLs work together in a real production environment?

6. We see Kubernetes on your resume. How do you expose applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster to external users?

7. Let’s say traffic is reaching the load balancer, but it is not reaching the pod. What are the possible reasons and what would you check first?

8. How do you manage secrets in your CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployments?

9. In your Jenkins pipelines, how do you control deployments across multiple environments like DEV, UAT, and PROD?

10. Can you explain how you have integrated security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline and at what stages?

11. Suppose a critical vulnerability is detected in production through a scan. What steps would you take immediately?

12. How do you ensure that your AWS IAM policies follow the principle of least privilege?

13. Have you worked with hybrid architectures? Can you explain how your on-prem infrastructure securely connects to cloud environments?

14. In your project, why did you introduce a DMZ layer for CI/CD, and what problem were you trying to solve?

15. What kind of monitoring and alerts do you usually configure for production systems?

16. Let’s say your application suddenly becomes slow in production. How do you identify whether it is an infrastructure issue or an application issue?

17. Can you explain the difference between ALB and NLB, and when you would choose one over the other?

18. How do you handle rollbacks if a deployment fails in production?

19. Have you ever handled a production incident? Walk me through what happened and how you resolved it.

20. How do you make sure that container images used in production are secure?

21. What is your approach to Kubernetes resource management, like CPU and memory requests and limits?

22. Suppose a pod is continuously restarting in production. How would you debug that issue?

23. How do you manage infrastructure changes using Terraform without impacting production stability?

24. What steps do you take to secure network communication between microservices?

25. How do you expose only required services to the internet while keeping internal services secure?

26. Have you worked with AWS WAF or similar tools? How do you use them in real projects?

27. How do you ensure high availability for applications running on Kubernetes or AWS?

28. What kind of logs do you collect in production, and how do you use them during troubleshooting?

29. How do you collaborate with developers and QA teams when a deployment or security issue occurs?

30. If we deploy you into our production environment tomorrow, what areas would you first look at to understand system stability and security?
